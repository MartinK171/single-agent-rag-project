# Testing Documentation - Single Agent RAG Router

## Overview
This document outlines the testing performed on the Single Agent RAG Router system to validate its core functionalities and demonstrate its capabilities. The system successfully implements a single-agent RAG architecture with routing capabilities to different tools based on query type.

## Test Environment
- Infrastructure: Docker containers
- Services:
  - Qdrant (Vector Database)
  - Ollama (LLM Service)
  - FastAPI (Main Application)
- Model: Llama2 (via Ollama)

## Functional Testing

### 1. Query Routing
The system was tested with different types of queries to verify correct routing behavior:

#### Web Search Query
```
Query: "What are the latest developments in AI?"
Result:
- Correctly identified as requiring current information
- Routed to web search tool
- Successfully retrieved and synthesized current information
- Query Type: WEB_SEARCH
- Confidence: 0.9
```

#### Knowledge Retrieval Query
```
Query: "Can you tell me what is RAG and how it works?"
Result:
- Correctly identified as requiring knowledge base access
- Retrieved relevant information from technical collection
- Provided accurate explanation based on retrieved context
- Query Type: RETRIEVAL
- Confidence: 0.8
```

#### Direct Query
```
Query: "Can you tell me a funny joke?"
Result:
- Correctly identified as requiring direct LLM response
- Routed to direct response without retrieval
- Generated appropriate humorous response
- Query Type: DIRECT
- Confidence: 1.0
```

#### Calculation Query
```
Query: "What is 15*25?"
Result:
- Correctly identified as mathematical operation
- Routed to calculator tool
- Provided accurate calculation: 375
- Query Type: CALCULATION
- Confidence: 0.95
```

## System Components Validation

### Vector Store Integration
- Successfully initialized technical and business collections
- Proper embedding generation and storage
- Effective similarity search functionality
- Appropriate context retrieval

### LLM Integration
- Successful model initialization
- Proper prompt handling
- Consistent response generation
- Appropriate context utilization

### Tool Integration
- Web Search: Successful DuckDuckGo integration
- Calculator: Accurate mathematical operations
- Vector Search: Proper collection routing and search
- Direct Response: Appropriate handling of straightforward queries

## Performance Observations

Response times were measured for different query types:
- Web Search Queries: ~160-170s
- Knowledge Retrieval: ~90-100s
- Direct Queries: ~60s
- Calculation Queries: ~45-50s

Note: These times are from a containerized environment running on CPU. Production deployment with GPU support would show significantly improved performance.

## Error Handling
The system demonstrates robust error handling:
- Graceful handling of service unavailability
- Proper fallback mechanisms
- Clear error messages
- Request validation
- Input sanitization

## API Endpoints
All API endpoints were tested and verified:
- `/query`: Main query endpoint
- `/health`: System health check
- `/stores`: Vector store management
- `/search/{store_name}`: Direct store search
- `/upload/files`: Document upload functionality
- `/upload/text`: Text content upload

## Future Improvements
While the PoC successfully demonstrates the core functionality, several areas could be enhanced:
1. Response time optimization
2. Query planning sophistication
3. Enhanced caching mechanisms
4. More comprehensive tool integration
5. Advanced query decomposition

## Conclusion
The Single Agent RAG Router PoC successfully demonstrates:
1. Proper implementation of agentic RAG architecture
2. Effective query routing
3. Tool integration and orchestration
4. Robust error handling
5. Scalable design
